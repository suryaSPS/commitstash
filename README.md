## The Problem

Writing good commit messages is tedious. Most developers either:
- Write vague messages like `fix bug` or `update stuff`
- Spend more time on the message than the actual change
- Skip conventions entirely under time pressure

## The Solution

`commitstash` reads your staged diff and generates a precise, conventional commit message using Claude or GPT — in under 3 seconds. No API key? Run it fully offline with `--no-ai` and it builds a message straight from the diff, or point it at a local model with Ollama.

It does more than messages:

- **Blocks secrets** — every commit is scanned for API keys, tokens, and credentials in your staged changes. Leaks are stopped before they land.
- **Reviews your diff** — `commitstash review` flags bugs and issues before you commit.
- **Writes your PR** — `commitstash pr` drafts a title and description from your branch's commits and diff.

```
git add orders/views.py orders/serializers.py

commitstash
```

```
Staged (2 files):
  · orders/views.py
  · orders/serializers.py

╭─ Suggested commit message ────────────────────────────────────╮
│ feat(orders): add bulk export endpoint with date range filters │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

[Enter] commit   e edit   r regenerate   q quit
>
✓ Committed successfully
```

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install commitstash
```

## Setup

```bash
# Anthropic Claude (default)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Or OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Add the export to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` so it persists.

**No API key?** Skip setup entirely and use offline mode — see [No-AI mode](#no-ai-offline-mode) below.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add <files>

# Generate and commit
commitstash
```

That's it. Press Enter to accept, `e` to edit, `r` to regenerate, `q` to quit.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Stage everything, then generate
commitstash -a

# Auto-accept without prompting (CI / hooks)
commitstash -a -y

# Change style for one commit
commitstash --style simple
commitstash --style angular

# Add emoji prefix  (✨ feat, 🐛 fix, ♻️ refactor...)
commitstash --emoji

# Include a commit body explaining WHY
commitstash --body

# Switch provider for one commit
commitstash --provider openai

# No API key — generate offline from the diff
commitstash --no-ai
```

---

## No-AI (offline) mode

Don't have an API key, working offline, or just want zero-cost commits? Add `--no-ai`
and `commitstash` builds the message locally by analyzing your staged diff — no network,
no key, no SDK required.

```bash
commitstash --no-ai        # generate offline
commitstash --no-ai -a -y  # stage all, offline, auto-accept
```

It inspects the diff to pick a sensible message:

| What it detects | Example output |
|---|---|
| Brand-new file(s) | `feat(auth): add login` |
| Docs / README changes | `docs: update README` |
| Test files | `test(tests): add test_llm` |
| Config / build files | `chore: update pyproject` |
| Mostly deletions | `refactor(api): remove legacy client` |
| File removals | `chore: remove old_helper` |

The type (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`test`/`chore`/`refactor`), scope (derived from the common
directory), and emoji all respect your configured style. It's a heuristic, not a mind
reader — press `e` to tweak anything before committing.

Make it the default so you never pass the flag:

```bash
commitstash configure   # choose "local" when prompted for provider
```

---

## Secret Scanning

Before every commit, `commitstash` scans your **staged changes** for secrets — AWS keys,
GitHub tokens, Anthropic/OpenAI keys, Slack/Stripe/Google keys, private key blocks, JWTs,
and hardcoded `password`/`api_key`/`token` assignments. If it finds one, the commit is
blocked and the finding is shown with the secret redacted:

```
╭──────────────── Secrets detected (1) ────────────────╮
│ AWS access key ID  config.py:12                      │
│     AKIAIOSF…MPLE                                     │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Only **added** lines are scanned, so pre-existing secrets in unrelated files don't block you.
Obvious placeholders (`your_key_here`, `xxxx`, `${VAR}`, `changeme`) are ignored.

Run the scan on its own — it exits non-zero when anything is found, so it drops straight into
a pre-commit hook or CI step:

```bash
commitstash scan
```

Turn the automatic commit-time gate off in `commitstash configure` (or set `"scan_secrets": false`
in your config).

---

## Review

Get a review of your staged diff before you commit:

```bash
commitstash review            # AI review with your configured provider
commitstash review --no-ai    # offline pattern checks only
```

With an AI provider it looks for bugs, security issues, and clear mistakes in the changed
lines. Offline mode is deterministic — it flags leftover debug statements (`print`,
`console.log`, `breakpoint()`), merge-conflict markers, and new `TODO`/`FIXME` comments —
and tells you it isn't a correctness review.

---

## Pull Requests

Draft a PR title and description from the commits and diff on your current branch:

```bash
commitstash pr                    # base branch autodetected (origin/HEAD, then main/master)
commitstash pr --base develop     # compare against a specific branch
commitstash pr --no-ai            # assemble from commit subjects, no API key
```

Output is a title plus a `## Summary` / `## Changes` / `## Testing` markdown body — paste it
straight into GitHub.

---

## Commit Styles

| Style | Example output |
|---|---|
| `conventional` (default) | `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation` |
| `angular` | `fix(orders): handle null warehouse on bulk export` |
| `simple` | `Fix null check in order serializer` |

---

## Configure

Run the interactive setup to save your preferences:

```bash
commitstash configure
```

Preferences are saved to `~/.commitstash/config.json`.
API keys are **never** written to disk — always read from environment variables.

<details>
<summary>Manual config (~/.commitstash/config.json)</summary>

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "style": "conventional",
  "include_scope": true,
  "include_body": false,
  "emoji": false,
  "max_diff_lines": 500,
  "scan_secrets": true,
  "ollama_model": "llama3.2",
  "ollama_host": "http://localhost:11434"
}
```

</details>

---

## Providers

| Provider | Default Model | Env Var |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` (default) | `claude-opus-4-8` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `gpt-4o-mini` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `ollama` | `llama3.2` (local LLM) | none |
| `local` | — (offline heuristic) | none |

Switch permanently:
```bash
commitstash configure   # select openai when prompted
```

Switch for one commit:
```bash
commitstash -p openai
```

### Ollama (local LLM)

Run a real model on your own machine — no API key, no network calls off-box:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2

commitstash -p ollama            # one commit
commitstash configure            # choose "ollama"; set model + host
```

Model and host are configurable (`ollama_model`, `ollama_host`).

---

## Git Hook

Install `commitstash` as a `prepare-commit-msg` hook so every `git commit` auto-generates a message:

```bash
commitstash install-hook
```

To uninstall:
```bash
rm .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```

---

## Commit Splitting

Staged everything at once? `commitstash split` clusters the staged files into
logical commits — source changes by scope, then tests, docs, and config — and
commits each group with its own generated message:

```
git add .
commitstash split

Proposed split (3 commits, AI grouping)

  Commit 1 — auth refactor
    · auth/views.py
    · auth/models.py
  Commit 2 — test changes
    · tests/test_auth.py
  Commit 3 — documentation
    · README.md

Create these commits? [y/N] > y
✓ 1/3  refactor(auth): move JWT validation into middleware
✓ 2/3  test(auth): cover middleware token validation
✓ 3/3  docs: document the new auth flow
```

AI providers propose the grouping from the diff; the response is strictly
validated (every staged file in exactly one group) and falls back to
deterministic grouping otherwise — `--no-ai` uses it directly. Splitting is
file-level, so a single file's hunks never end up divided across commits.
Files with both staged *and* unstaged edits abort the split rather than
silently dragging unstaged work into a commit.

---

## Explain & Changelog

```bash
# Plain-language explanation of the staged diff — what, why, impact, risk
commitstash explain

# Changelog section from conventional commits since the last tag
commitstash changelog

# ...or a labelled release, prepended to CHANGELOG.md
commitstash changelog --label v0.3.0 --write
```

`changelog` is deliberately deterministic — the same history always produces
the same changelog, so it needs no API key and works in CI.

`commitstash` also reads your recent commit history when generating messages,
so suggestions match the tone and scope conventions your repo already uses.

---

## Custom Providers

Backends are pluggable. Anything that can complete a prompt can drive every
feature — subclass, register, done:

```python
from commitstash.providers import LLMProvider, register

class GroqProvider(LLMProvider):
    name = "groq"

    def complete(self, prompt, config, max_tokens=1024):
        ...  # call any API you like

register(GroqProvider())
```

---
